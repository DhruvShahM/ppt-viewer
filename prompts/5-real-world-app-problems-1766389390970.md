I will give you 5 real-world APP PROBLEMS (not puzzles) with the programming language for each.

Your task:

1. For each problem, create a JSON object in this exact format:

{
  "snippets": [
    {
      "title": "<short descriptive title>",
      "code": "<programming language, 15–25 lines, self-contained, solves the REAL APP PROBLEM, minimal inline comments, include // Output: with realistic sample output.

      Rules:
      - Add a top comment with the language (e.g., # Python, // Go).
      - Start with a short comment describing the USER-FACING PROBLEM.
      - Add logic explanation comments where helpful for beginners.
      - Keep lines ≤ 52 chars, wrap if longer.
      - Must feel like a SIMPLE REAL APP (e.g., expense tracker, shopping cart, reminder, etc.), not a coding puzzle.
      - End with realistic sample output using // Output:>", 
      "hook": "<1-line retention hook>"
    }
  ]
}

2. Requirements:
- Each snippet must be a different real-world app idea.
- Code must be runnable, beginner-friendly, and practical.
- No external libraries unless necessary.
- Each snippet needs: catchy title, clear comments, sample output, strong 1-line hook.

3. Return all 5 snippets together inside the "snippets" array in one JSON object.


zI want you to:
1. Generate 10 viral YouTube Shorts ideas that are focused on following interview Q&A, pitfalls, or coding challenges. Each idea must have:


A killer hook in the first 3 seconds.
A clear structure for 30–60 seconds (problem > solution > quick tip).
A call-to-action (like comment, share, or watch next).programming langage name added.
2. Suggest 5 click-worthy titles and thumbnails for each idea (SEO + curiosity-based).

3. Provide 1 full 30-second script for the highest potential idea.

4. Optimize retention: ensure fast pacing, pattern interrupts, and rewatch loops.

5. Suggest the best posting time strategy and hashtags to test for maximum reach.
6. Add the programming lanuage name
7. please give me the question only relvant programming langauge
