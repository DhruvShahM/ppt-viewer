🔥 PPT Script + Motion Graphics Guide
📘 Topic: Rate Limiting — In-depth Explained (Beginner Friendly)

Perfect for animated PPT / YouTube explanation video.

🟦 Slide 1 — Title Slide
Title: Rate Limiting — In-depth Explained
Subtitle: “How systems control and limit traffic safely”
🎬 Animations:

Slow zoom-in title

Flowing gradient

Small floating particles

🟦 Slide 2 — What is Rate Limiting?
Text:

Rate Limiting is a technique used to control how many requests a user or service can make in a given time period.

Examples:

“Max 100 requests per minute”

“Only 5 login attempts per hour”

🎬 Motion:

Tap icon → multiple taps → “STOP” animation

Counter increasing → then freezing

🟦 Slide 3 — Why Rate Limiting is Needed?
Problems solved:

Prevent DDoS attacks

Stop API abuse

Protect servers from overload

Reduce cost & misuse

Ensure fair usage

🎬 Motion:

Server shaking under heavy load

Shield icon appears

Traffic flow calms down

🟦 Slide 4 — Basic Flow of Rate Limiting
Flow:

Client → API Gateway → Rate Limiter → Application

🎬 Motion:

Arrows flow left to right

Rate limiter icon acts like a “gate” opening/closing

Requests exceeding limit bounce back

🟦 Slide 5 — Popular Rate Limiting Algorithms
List:

Fixed Window

Sliding Window

Token Bucket

Leaky Bucket

🎬 Motion:

4 cards flip in

Icons appear with bounce

🟦 Slide 6 — Fixed Window Algorithm
Text:

Time divided into equal windows (1 minute, 10 sec, etc.)

Max allowed requests per window

Simple but has “burst” problem

🎬 Motion:

Clock animation jumping frame-by-frame

Requests stacking inside the window

Burst animation near window boundary

🟦 Slide 7 — Sliding Window Algorithm
Text:

More accurate rate control

Uses timestamps

Reduces burst issue

🎬 Motion:

Timeline slider moving smoothly

Requests entering a “moving window”

🟦 Slide 8 — Token Bucket Algorithm
Text:

Bucket fills with tokens at a steady rate

Each request consumes 1 token

Allows short bursts

🎬 Motion:

Bucket animation with tokens dropping

Requests picking tokens

Bucket empty → request denied

🟦 Slide 9 — Leaky Bucket Algorithm
Text:

Works like a leaking bucket

Outputs requests at a constant rate

Smoothens traffic spikes

🎬 Motion:

Bucket leaking water

Requests dropping at controlled speed

Overflow request shown as “Rejected”

🟦 Slide 10 — How Systems Enforce Rate Limits
Techniques:

API Gateway (Nginx, Kong, Traefik)

Redis counters

IP-based limits

User-based limits

Key-based limits (API Keys)

Motion:

Ping animations on each tool logo

Cards slide left/right

🟦 Slide 11 — Where Rate Limiting is Used?
Use Cases:

Login attempts

API usage

Payment requests

File upload limits

Messaging apps

🎬 Motion:

Icons appear with bounce

Slow pulse animation on API icon

🟦 Slide 12 — What Happens When Limit is Exceeded?
Results:

HTTP 429 Too Many Requests

Retry-After header

Temporary block

Redirect to queue

Motion:

Red alert animation

“429” shakes

Timer appears (Retry header)

🟦 Slide 13 — Distributed Rate Limiting
Text:

Needed for:

Microservices

Multi-region systems

High-scale APIs

Usually uses:

Redis

In-memory clusters

API Gateways with shared counters

Motion:

Multi-server diagram

Central Redis cache glowing

Network lines animated

🟦 Slide 14 — Summary (Animated Recap)
Points:

✔️ Controls API traffic
✔️ Prevents abuse
✔️ Ensures fair usage
✔️ Protects backend systems
✔️ Uses smart algorithms (Fixed / Sliding / Bucket models)

Motion:

Each line slides from different direction

Highlight effect on keywords

🟦 Slide 15 — Thank You
Motion:

Fade-in text

Subtle flowing background animation
